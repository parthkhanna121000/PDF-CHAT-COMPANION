# PDF Chat Companion

## Project Overview

PDF Chat Companion is a React.js-based web application that allows users to upload PDF files and interact with the content through a chat interface. Users can ask questions related to the PDF, receive AI-generated responses, and manage multiple PDFs—all through a clean, responsive UI.

> **Note:** Currently, only the frontend is fully implemented. Backend integration and AI functionalities are planned for future development.

## Project Structure

* `src/components/` — Reusable React components (Auth, PDFUpload, Chat, Dashboard)
* `src/api/` — Axios setup and API call placeholders
